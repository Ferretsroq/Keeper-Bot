Spend your hold during the mystery to ask the Keeper any one of the following questions:\n1) Is this person connected to current events more than they are saying?\n2) When and where will the next critical event occur?\n3) What does the monster want from this person?\n4) Is this connected to previous mysteries we have investigated?\n5) How does this mystery connect to the bigger picture?",

On a 10+, they're available and helpful - they can fix something, break a code, hack a computer, or get you some special information. On a 7-9, they're prepared to help, but it's either going to take some time or you going to have to do part of it yourself. On a miss, you burn some bridges.",
