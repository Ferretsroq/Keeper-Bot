Choose two good things and one bad thing about it.\nGood things: roomy; surveillance gear; fast; stealthy; intimidating; classic; medical kit; sleeping space; toolkit; concealed weapons; anonymous; armoured (+1 armour inside); tough; monster cage.\nBad things: loud; obvious; temperamental; beaten-up; gas-guzzler; uncomfortable; slow; old.",
    "move7": "**Deal With the Agency:**\nWhen you **deal with the Agency**, requesting help or gear, or making excuses for a failure, roll +Sharp. On a 10+, you're good - your request for gear or personnel is okayed, or your slip-up goes unnoticed. On a 7-9, things aren't so great. You might get chewed out by your superiors and there'll be fallout, but you get what you need for the job. On a miss, you screwed up: you might be suspended or under investigation, or just in the doghouse. You certainly aren't going to get any help until you sort it all out.",
