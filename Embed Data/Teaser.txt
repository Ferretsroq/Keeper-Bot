It's dark and rainy, with thunder crashing all around Animal Control Officer Webb. He parked his truck away from the riverbank and left the headlights on so he could see while he walked on down. The police had gotten a call about some big alligator in these waters biting people, and they'd called him to take care of it. He told officer Jenkins that it was just some high school kids making a crank call - the gators have just as much a right to the river as any humans do, and ain't nobody showed up to the hospital with bite marks. Still, here he was, in the middle of the night in a downpour, searching for an aggressive alligator. Webb wades into the mud and shines his flashlight around where the headlights don't reach - all he sees is water getting churned up by the rain. He's about to call it a night and head home, have a warm cup of tea and see if he can catch the last bit of the game. Lightning crashes directly overhead, so bright he can actually see the water. He can see something there, he looks over to it - the flash of light doesn't go away when the lightning does. The light gets brighter and brighter, and it's all that officer Webb can see, blinding him. He takes a step further into the mud. Another step. He walks all the way down into the water as the light subsides, and he is never heard from again.

Officer Jenkins, who took the call about the alligator, couldn't get ahold of Webb all night. He reassured himself by saying that Webb was fine, he's just going to poke around the Savannah River, nothing he hasn't done a million times. Still, something didn't feel right. He left the station around 6 AM, as his shift was ending. Jenkins took the long way home by the river, and he took it real slow in the rain so he could see. And he saw Officer Webb's truck parked right by the riverside, with a dead battery, and footprints leading down into the water.
