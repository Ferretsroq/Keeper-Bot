This is the basic fighting move, covering the back and forth of a short
burst of fighting, rather than a single attack.

By default when a hunter **kicks ass** both sides inflict harm as
established-the hunter with their weapon and the enemy theirs. The
precise amount of harm that's traded will depend on whatâ€™s happening
at that moment in the fight.

```
When you get into a fight and kick some ass, roll +Tough.

On any success (i.e., total 7 or more) you inflict harm on
(and suffer harm from) whatever you're fighting. The amount
of harm is based on the established dangers in the game. That
usually means you inflict the harm rating of your weapon and
your enemies inflict their attack's harm rating on you.

If you roll a 10+, choose one extra effect:

* You gain the advantage: take +1 forward, or give +1
forward to another hunter.
* You inflict terrible harm (+1 harm).
* You suffer less harm (-1 harm).
* You force them where you want them.

On a miss, you get your ass kicked instead. You suffer
harm or get captured, but don't inflict any harm back.
