This is used when a hunter wants to help another hunter make a move.
Helping will give the other hunter +1 on a single roll. It's okay to see
what the result is before deciding to help out, as long as it still makes
sense that the hunter could do something to help improve the results.

```
When you help another hunter with a move they are making,
roll +Cool.
* On a 10+ your help grants them +1 to their roll.
* On a 7-9 your help grants them +1 to their roll, but you
also expose yourself to trouble or danger.
* On a failure, you expose yourself to trouble or danger
without helping.
