This covers trying to do something under conditions of particular
stress or danger. Examples of acting under pressure are:
staying on task while a banshee screams at you; barricading a
door before the giant rats catch up; resisting the mental domination
of a brain-worm; fighting on when you're badly injured.

```
When you act under pressure, roll +Cool.
* On a 10+ you do what you set out to.
* On a 7-9 the Keeper is going to give you a worse
outcome, hard choice, or price to pay.
* On a miss, things go to hell.
