This can be used any time someone is about to suffer harm, including
as the result of another move (i.e. a **kick some ass** move that means a
hunter is going to suffer harm).

```
When you prevent harm to another character, roll +Tough.

On any success (i.e., 7 or more), you protect them okay,
but you'll suffer some or all of the harm they were going to get.

If you got a 10+ choose an extra:
* You suffer little harm (-1 harm).
* All impending danger is now focused on you.
* You inflict harm on the enemy.
* You hold the enemy back.

On a miss, then you end up making things worse.
