This move is used when you want someone to do something
for you. You'll need a good reason for them to do it, and what
counts as a good reason depends on what you are asking for
and your relationship with them.

For friends and allies, you might just need to ask. For witnesses
to a monster attack, you could tell them you are with
the police, or just offer them some cash for answering your
questions.

```
Once you have given them a reason, tell them what you
want them to do and roll +Charm.

For a normal person:

* If you get 10+, then they'll do it for the reason you gave
them. If you asked too much, they'll tell you the minimum
it would take for them to do it (or if there's no way they'd
do it).
* On a 7-9, they'll do it, but only if you do something for
them right now to show that you mean it. If you asked too
much, they'll tell you what, if anything, it would take for
them to do it.
* On a miss, your approach is completely wrong: you offend
or anger the target.

For another hunter:

* On a 10+ they mark experience and get +1 forward if they
do what you ask.
* On a 7-9, they mark experience if they do what you ask.
* On a miss, it's up to that hunter to decide how badly you
offend or annoy them. They mark experience if they do not
do what you asked.
