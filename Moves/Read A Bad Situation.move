```
When you look around and read a bad situation, roll +Sharp.

On a 10+ hold 3, and on a 7-9 hold 1.

One hold can be spent to ask the Keeper one of the following
questions:
* What's my best way in?
* What's my best way out?
* Are there any dangers we haven't noticed?
* What's the biggest threat?
* What's most vulnerable to me?
* What's the best way to protect the victims?

If you act on the answers, you get +1 ongoing while the
information is relevant. For example, if you ask for the best
way in to the monster's lair then you'll get +1 while you are
infiltrating it. But once you're in, the information doesn't help
you any more.

On a miss, you might mis-read the situation (e.g. "Everything
is fine here! It will be totally safe to go investigate alone!"),
or you might reveal tactical details to your enemies (which
means the Keeper can ask the questions above of you).
