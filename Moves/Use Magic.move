```
When you use magic, say what you're trying to achieve and how
you do the spell, then roll +Weird.

* If you get a 10+, the magic works without issues: choose
your effect.
* On a 7-9, it works imperfectly: choose your effect and a
glitch. The Keeper will decide what effect the glitch has.
* On a miss, you lose control of the magic. This never ends well.
By default the magic has one of the effects listed below, lasts for
around thirty minutes, and does not expose you to danger, unwanted
attention, or side-effects. If there's a glitch this might change.
