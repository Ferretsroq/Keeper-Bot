Investigating can be done any number of ways: following
tracks, interviewing witnesses, forensic analysis, looking up
old folklore in a library, typing the monster's name into Google,
capturing the monster and conducting tests on it, and so on.
Anything that might give you more information about what's
going on is fair game for an investigate move.

```
When you investigate a mystery, roll +Sharp.
On a 10+ hold 2, and on a 7-9 hold 1.
One hold can be spent to ask the Keeper one of the following
questions:
* What happened here?
* What sort of creature is it?
* What can it do?
* What can hurt it?
* Where did it go?
* What was it going to do?
* What is being concealed here?

On a miss, you reveal some information to the monster
or whoever you are talking to. The Keeper might ask you some
questions, which you have to answer.
```

It's important that your attempts to investigate (and the
results you get from them) are plausible and consistent with
what's happening. For example, if you're using laboratory
equipment to investigate evidence, you probably won't be able
to learn anything about the monster's magical origins.
